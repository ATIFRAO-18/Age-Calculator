# Age-Calculator
It's my 2nd Project by using HTML , CSS & JAVASCRIPT.
<br>
**Key Features:**
<br>
It has user-friendly interface and well adopted.
<br>
User can calculate his/her age in Years , Months & Days.
<br>
The user enters their date of birth using a date input field.
<br>
Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, JavaScript fetches the current date and compares it with the entered date of birth.
<br>
The app then calculates the difference in years, months, and days, taking into account leap years and varying month lengths.
<br>
The result is displayed on the screen, showing the user's exact age.
